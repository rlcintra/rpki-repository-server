* rpki-repository-server

An implementation of the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP) ([[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8182][RFC 8182]]).

** Status

This implementation is under development and it is not yet ready for production. Currently it only allows mirroring 
RSYNC repositories and serve them through.

Future planned work will implement support for the Publication Protocol
([[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8181][RFC 8181]]) and partial support to the Out-of-band Setup Protocol
([[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8183][RFC 8183]]).

Version 1.0 is mostly done pending better testing, logging and improving documentation.

** Building and running

This project uses [[https://haskellstack.org][Stack]] for building. You can compile the server by running:

#+BEGIN_SRC
stack build
#+END_SRC

This will generate the server binary.

Running tests can be accomplished by:

#+BEGIN_SRC
stack test
#+END_SRC

You can also run the server directly through Stack with:

#+BEGIN_SRC
stack exec rpki-repository-server
#+END_SRC

** Configuration

A configuration file must be provided for the server initialisation. By default the server will look for a
=config.yml= file at the current directory. A sample configuration file can be found at the project's root directory.
